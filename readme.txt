Welcome to the "kitchen!"

This is a custom shopping cart that's being put together for "RTA Kitchen Cabinets." You can see their current website at http://www.rtakitchencabinetsonline.com/.

You'll find the database file along with everything else that you'll need to set up your local environment. 

In order to complete this project, here's what needs to happen:

1) Add "My Account" icon and have it go to page where customer can edit their info and view any orders that are pending.

2) Complete the ordering process. It ends at checkout_post.php. From there it needs to be routed to either the credit card interface, Paypal or a page where they're agreeing to pay by check. At the point their credit card is validated and / or their Paypal account is good to go, they need to go to a page where the customer is confirmed and they get an email confirming their order. Also, the order_admin table also needs to be updated as "paid."

3) The admin page includes an interface that allows the administrator to view a list of all orders - both those that are pending and those that have been paid for. That same page allows the user to "check" off those that have been shipped.

6) The entire site needs to be converted to a Bootstrap site. I've include separate "cabinet pull" graphics in the "bootstrap images" folder so you can stack those images for mobile devices.

The entire budget for this project is $500.00. Regardless of your hourly rate / how much time it takes you to complete the above tasks, that $500.00 is yours. If it takes more time than what you originally estimated, your compenstation is $500.00. Then again, if it takes less time, you still get paid the entire 500 dollar amount.
