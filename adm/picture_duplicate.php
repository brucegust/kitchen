			You're trying to upload a photo that has the same file name as one that's already in the database. For example, if you're trying to upload "showdown.jpg," and you're getting this page, that means there's already a "showdown.jpg" in the database. Give your image a different file name, then click on the "back" button of your browser and try again.
